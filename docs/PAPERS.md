## Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance

This paper describes Query Plan Guidance (QPG), a test case generation method guided by query plan coverage. This method can be paired with above three testing methods. A preprint is available [here](http://jinshengba.me/assets/pdf/qpg_icse23.pdf).

# Comparing SQLancer With Other Tools that Find Logic Bugs

If you want to fairly compare other tools with SQLancer, we would be glad to provide feedback (e.g., feel free to send an email to manuel.rigger@inf.ethz.ch). We have the following general recommendations and comments:
* PostgreSQL and SQLite are DBMSs that we comprehensively tested, and where all or most of the bugs that SQLancer could find were fixed. We believe these two systems to be the most challenging test targets. Finding bugs that the approaches implemented in SQLancer overlooked in these systems might thus best demonstrate a new approach's effectiveness. For some other DBMSs like MySQL and MariaDB, SQLancer could still detect unreported bugs; we stopped testing these DBMSs and reporting bugs due to the large number of unfixed bugs.
* We programmatically disabled the generation of features that are likely to trigger known bugs (e.g., see [TiDB](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/src/sqlancer/tidb/TiDBBugs.java)). If a comparison investigates metrics such as code coverage that is achieved when fuzzing a DBMS, it might be desirable to enable the generation of such features.
* For the default SQLite JDBC driver, a number of extensions (e.g., the [soundex function](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#soundex)) are disabled by default, which is why they are also disabled by default in the DBMS' options (e.g., see [SQLite3Options](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/c71b9741f680f4877fc5047445787ed184a5a5e0/src/sqlancer/sqlite3/SQLite3Options.java#L67)). To investigate metrics such as code coverage, it might again be desirable to enable such options.
* The maximum expression depth (see the `--max-expression-depth` option), the number of queries issued per database (see the `--num-queries` option), and the number of tables and views that are created (currently, SQLancer does not have an option to set these) significantly influence the tool's effectiveness and performance characteristics. It might be desirable to experiment with different values for the expression depth (e.g., values between 2 and 4), the number of queries (1000-100,000), as well as the number of tables and views.
