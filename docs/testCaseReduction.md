# Test Case Reduction
SQLancer generates a large number of statements, but not all of them are relevant to the bug. To automatically reduce the test cases, two reducers were implemented: the statement reducer and the AST-based reducer.

## Statement Reducer
The statement reducer utilizes the delta-debugging technique to remove irrelevant statements. More details of delta-debugging could be found in this paper: [Simplifying and Isolating Failure-Inducing Input](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/fall07/Papers/delta-debugging.pdf). 

Using the statement reducer, SQLancer reduces the set of statements to a minimal subset that reproduces the bug. 

## AST-Based Reducer
The AST-based reducer can shorten a statement by applying AST level transformations, including removing unnecessary clauses, irrelevant elements in a list, simplify complicated expressions and etc. 

The transformations are implemented by [JSQLParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser), a RDBMS agnostic SQL statement parser that can translate SQL statements into a traversable hierarchy of Java classes. JSQLParser provides support for the SQL standard as well as major SQL dialects. The AST-based reducer works for any SQL dialects that can be parsed by this tool.

## Enable reducers
Test-case reduction is disabled by default. The statement reducer can be enabled by passing `--use-reducer` when starting SQLancer. If you wish to further shorten each statements, you need to additionally pass the `--reduce-ast` parameter so that the AST-based reduction is applied. 

Note: if `--reduce-ast` is set, `--use-reducer` option must be enabled first.

There are also options to define timeout seconds and max steps of reduction for both statement reducer and AST-based reducer.

```
--statement-reducer-max-steps=<steps>
--statement-reducer-max-time=<seconds>
--ast-reducer-max-steps=<steps>
--ast-reducer-max-time=<seconds>
```

## Reduction logs
If test-case reduction is enabled, each time the reducer performs a reduction step successfully,it prints the reduced statements to the log file, overwriting the previous ones.

The log files will be stored in the following format: `logs/<DBMS>/reduce/<database>-reduce.log`. For instance, if the tested DBMS is SQLite3 and the current database is named database0, the log file will be located at `logs/sqlite3/reduce/database0-reduce.log`.
